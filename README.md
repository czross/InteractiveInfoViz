# InteractiveInfoViz

A good portion of the code was from Mike Freeman's m.8 exercise 3 on github.

The data set that I used is from a group within the University of Washington who help facilitate the Greater Washington
State HERC (Higher Education Recruitment Consortium).  The data relates to the different interactions that the HERC
website has such as viewers, people who apply, and jobs posted.  Each of these different factors relate to the different
questions that clients of the website have such as, how many jobs have they posted, how many views has their page had,
and most importantly how many applications have they gotten with HERC.  The decision to use a bar chart revolves around
the elementary perceptual task of position encoding.  This means the a user can immediately tell the difference between
the different bars.  Another thing that the position recognition allows for a viewer to decode is the actual data that
relates to each of the bars.  This along with the filters, allow for a user to find the specific information that relates
to the topic that they are interested in.  Finally I had wanted to show a stacked bar chart in order to demonstrate the
total activity each of the schools' page has, but the implementation alluded me in the time allotted.  Oops.
